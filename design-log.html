            <h3>Monday</h3>

            <p>On Monday we were introduced to web design and was told to look for some inspiration on Pinterest. We then started to learn about the applications used within creating a website e.g. Atom, GitHub. After we learnt the basics, we got to choose a template for our own website and then made it a live site.</p>

<p>The second part of the session on Monday included understanding the works of a camera and the main aspects to take into consideration when it comes to taking photos.</p>

<p>Using the information learnt for web design will familiarise me with the terms and apps used when creating a website, this means that when it comes to my final portfolio, I will have a better idea of what to do.</p>

<p>The photography element taught me the basic understanding you need when working with the cameras and also what to take into consideration when taking images.</p>

            <h3>Tuesday</h3>

            <p>Tuesdays session on web design included getting to know GitHub and knowing how to link pages and change titles. Also, our site isn’t exactly the same how I see it when editing as to how others see it when I’ve finished editing, therefore we learnt how to check how the site looks from opening up the original link.</p>
  <p>For photography on the Tuesday we experimented with the camera ourselves and had the challenge to practice some different camera shots and angles.</p>
  <p>All skills learnt in today’s web design session further informed me and gave me more knowledge as to how to work GitHub and Atom correctly. This will help me to know how to keep checking my final portfolio when I start to design it and make sure it looks right to other people viewing it.</p>
  <p>Taking the shots today was a great way to familiarise me with the camera and earn new skills for the future which will help when it comes to my final portfolio.</p>

            <h3>Wednesday</h3>
<p>For digital Wednesday we were set to read the Dieter Rams Design Principles presentation, pick a principle and then find two websites that correlated to the principle and explain why. Helped us to get a better understanding on web design and take some inspiration for our own website.</p>

            <h3>Thursday</h3>

            <p>Thursday, we site mapped our website, we discussed what pages we wanted on it and what titles there would be, then on the wireframes we wrote what content we would put on each page. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Lawrence’s session a guest speaker from Salford City Football Club came in to speak about social media marketing, how he edits some of his interviews, and gave tips on filming where he mentioned the rule of third.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I will use the sitemap I designed today on paper as a plan for my final portfolio it will help me setup to be clearer and easier to understand. The helpful tips and tricks that the guest speaker gave will help me when I apply them to when I edit video or even some of what he said will apply when I use photography.</p>

            <h3>Friday</h3>
<p>This session we were introduced to google fonts where we chose a font which we liked then made that font able to use within our own websites and changed the title fonts from our original template in Atom. Google fonts is something I can use in the future throughout web design and was a great technique to use which I understand and will be able to apply.</p>

                <h3>Monday</h3>
                <p>In web design we were taught how to change colours, and how to inspect into titles we want to change on the browser and then transfer that to Atom and finding the code.Monday’s lesson we opened up Canon Play which allowed us to experiment with changing the exposure, aperture, f stop and shutter speed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This session allowed me to improve on how to inspect code and will help me when it comes to my final portfolio. I will apply the information I learnt in Canon Play to when I physically use the camera because the things I did wrong in the app learnt me how to not use the settings and what settings to change in order to get a great picture.</p>

                <p>Tuesday we were taught how to embed imagery using Unsplashed Source onto our web pages by using &lt;img&gt; tag. We then were told how to embed code snippets.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday we learnt about photoshop and how to use the basic tools and how to change the brightness, exposure, etc. Learning how to input images is what I will take with me when I do my portfolio and the editing techniques I used will help when I take my own images and edit them.</p>

                <h3>Wednesday</h3>

                <p>For this week digital Wednesday, we read about 'anatomy' of a HTML element and a CSS ruleset, then we had to write an entry for the glossary on one of the meanings we learnt through reading. This refreshed our knowledge and allowed us to be more understanding of the topic.</p>

                <h3>Thursday</h3>

                <p>I touched up on my web design making sure every link and button worked I also made sure the link worked for everyone else and changed a few titles so the corresponded with each page.</p>
  <p>For our class with Lawrence we went out to take images in the Northern Quatre because we chose to focus our images on Graffiti in Manchester. We practised our techniques learnt throughout the last week or so and put them into practise by experimenting with the settings, angles and shots.</p>
  <p>This just helped me to realise double checking is important and something I will frequently do in order to make sure everything runs smooth and looks professional.</p>
  <p>Going out to take the images let me take all the information we have learnt into account and apply it to my practical skills it gave me an even better understanding overall of how to take better pictures because not all my pictures were perfect and I now know how I would improve if I was to go out and take pictures again.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>Monday</h3>

                    <p>In today’s session with Christine we looked into how to change the colour scheme of your website using Atom and GitHub. With Lawrence we were taught how to set up audio recording using the Zoom recorder, I then went ahead and watched the video shared on teams for further support. &nbsp;(Bhphotovideo.com, 2019)</p>
  <p>I will use the colour techniques learnt to change the layout in preparation for my web design to look more professional and appealing for 18-34-year olds working in the create industry. I will do this by using quite neutral tones of colour like black, white and grey. Furthermore, I will be using the Zoom recorder throughout university and when I eventually go into the world of media, I imagine I will be using it quite a lot then also, it’s a skill I will need and use over and over. For this assignment I will be using the audio recording as part of our second assignment. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>In this session we learnt about what CSS and HTML is and then learnt about interview techniques. Learning about web terms will help me understand more about what to do when it comes to web design, getting used to the terms will help when it comes to editing my web design myself.</p>

                    <h3>Wednesday</h3>

                    <p>Digital Wednesday consisted of answering questions on Kahoot on what we have learnt so far in lessons. Then we went onto Padlet and were told to explain about websites we like and are easy to use and why and then discuss the websites we don’t like and why. I decided to say that I found the website Missguided easy to use as it was clearly set out into categories and was easy to locate around, on the other hand I found it difficult around Supreme because the writing was small and not clearly set into categories.</p>

                    <p>This session i was taught about the importance of forms and how If you don’t get certain consent forms signed then if there’s any interference in the future it could potentially ruin your piece of work.&nbsp;(Bbc.com, 2019)</p>
  <p>With Christine we learnt how to save images edited through photoshop for the web tool. In future projects I will get those participating to send consent and release forms so its wont delay or potentially stop them from happening if something went wrong. This allowed me to realise the importance of forms and how to not mess up by not having them in the future.</p>

                    <p>Friday’s session consisted of getting to know a bit more about colour for websites and understanding the way colour contrasting works. We also used the website html colour codes to get our HTML code snippets to change background and text colours. I then went into Manchester with Emily and Adam to take some images for the theme Street Art, the Northern Quarter was full of great creative and artistic work on buildings and walls.</p>
  <p>Taking the images and learning more about colour contrasting was great for me to develop with my media skills. </p>

We went out to take images in Manchester and also come back and edit our favorites on Photoshop using saturation, lighting, contrast and many more. Using the idea of UX in mind will make me change certain aspects of my website to make it more approachable and easier for people to use. </p>
